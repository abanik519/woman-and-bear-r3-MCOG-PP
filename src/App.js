                  Today you will read "The Woman and her Bear" for the third
                  time. Afterwards we will ask you to retell the story. It is
                  easier to remember a story if you know that most stories have
                  a similar structure as shown here in this chart. A story
                  begins with the exposition - this is the part that introduces
                  the characters and the setting and gets the story started.
                  Then the plot gets going with rising actions - these are the
                  events that lead up to the climax. The rising actions usually
                  involve at least one problem that must be solved. The climax
                  is the point of major tension in the story. After the climax
                  there are falling actions. These are plot events that lead
                  toward the resolution of the problem or the conflict. Finally
                  there is the resolution of the problem. Today when you read
                  the story for the last time you can think about where the
                  events in the story fit into this story arc.

                    known as a the Inuit. They lived on the shores of the icy
                    Arctic. They depended upon the bounty of the salmon and seal
                    and the creatures of the snow to feed themselves. All the
                    young men were hunters and fishers.

                    ice, picked up the cub and looked into his eyes. "You will

                    Kuink grew taller and smarter. The children taught him to
                    fish. By springtime he was fishing on his own, and every
                    afternoon he came home carrying fresh salmon for his mother.
                    The old woman was now the happiest of all the villagers. She
                    was so proud of the her little bear that whenever he
                    returned home, she would say proudly to anyone nearby, "He's
                    the finest fisher in all the village."

                    Before long the men began to began to feel envious. "What

                    the fattest seals and the biggest salmon. "He must be

                    a danger to our families." The men decided to kill the bear.

                    their envy made them mean.
